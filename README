DISCLAIMER
==========
This is a work in progress. The best you can currently expect from this
filesystem is to cause performance degradation and possible data corruption.
Do not use to store anything you're not willing to lose!

OVERVIEW
========
PotatoFS is a FUSE filesystem implementation that aims to to store data on
high-lacency backends, for instance one of the many cloud storage options.
It then uses local, lower-lacenty storage to cache data and perform I/O
operations on portions of cached data.

There are a few major goals PotatoFS is trying to achieve:

  1) Backend agnosticism:

     PotatoFS invokes external commands in order to retrieve or store
     data to the high-latency backends.

  2) Avoid reimplementing encryption and compression:

     PotatoFS should rely on external commands to compress and/or
     encrypt data before sending it to the backends. If local encryption
     is desired, it should be done at another layer, e.g. LUKS, or a
     stackable filesystem.

  3) As a stretch goal, concurrent mounting:

     Multiple instances of PotatoFS should be able to mount the filesystem
     concurrently while preserving consistency. This would be achieved by
     having the PotatoFS instances communicate with one another.

Non-goals:

  1) Portability. Though I would like this to work on all BSDs, there is
     a dependency on low-level FUSE, which not all BSDs support. We
     currently don't care about endianness. On-disk format is
     platform-dependant. Maybe one day we'll care and do all the
     byte-swapping, though it's unsure how that would affect performance.

  2) Find a cool unique name. Finding a free 5-letter acronym ending in
     "-FS" is next to impossible these days:

     So meet PotatoFS. Potatoes are nourishing and can easily complement
     a wide variety of dishes.

DESIGN NOTES
============
We should be able to use FUSE multithreading and splicing, however no
writeback since we plan on allowing multiple writers, eventually.
See: https://marc.info/?l=fuse-devel&m=150640983731277&w=2

	"This mode assumes that all changes to the filesystem go through the
	FUSE kernel module (size and atime/ctime/mtime attributes are kept
	up-to-date by the kernel), so it's generally not suitable for network
	filesystems."

Currently the filesystem uses O_SYNC for directory data and inode tables.
Maybe one day we can add journaling or soft updates.

Inode struct is 4K. The reasoning behind this is that since we expect the
backend to be *really* slow, we want to get the most of our fetching slabs.
With the default values, inode tables can store 2048 inodes, and their first
~4K of data is stored directly in the inode, meaning small directories and
small files require no further download from the backend. This should make
directory listing and things like 'head' or 'file', or 'grep' on small text
files to proceed quickly enough. Doing a bit of stats on my own home
directory, a large majority of files are under 4K in size.

Directory entries are currently a fixed size, with 255 bytes reserved for
file names. This is no ideal, and someday I might go back and handle
variable-sized records for filenames.
