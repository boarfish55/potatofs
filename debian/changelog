potatofs (2.12.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update description
  * Fix reference from potatofs(1) -> potatofs.conf(5)
  * cleanup
  * Adjust logging and ignore some more signals.
    The unmount sequence still seems problematic when the OS it shutting down.
    Increase logging in fs_destroy() and block some more signals just in case
    we're getting something unexpected.
  * Follow Debian's version scheme; this is a non-native package
