potatofs (2.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  v2.8.0
  * Add dependency for golang-github-mattn-go-sqlite3-dev
  * Add hints and preload functionality to backend_s3
  * Add a NOHINT flag when opening slabs to avoid triggering a hint on the
    backend. This is to prevent looping indefinitely by triggering another
    hint when preloading a slab.
  * Add new counters for backend puts/gets/hints; this lets us compute a
    rough local cache hit ratio which we display in ctop.
  * Fix claim contention counter in ctop (was displaying the wrong counter)

potatofs (2.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  v2.6.1
  Fix a few bugs, some major:
  * Truncate slabs in copy_outgoing_slab() and copy_incoming_slab(),
    otherwise we can end up with trailing bytes from a previous iteration.
    This causes those slabs to have the wrong CRC, preventing them from being
    used. Corruption, essentially.
  * Fix cast in slabdb for flags; just use uint32_t. Sqlite doesn't store
    short ints like uint8_t.
  * Fix possible bad file descriptor in failure situations in claim()
  * Have fs_sync() handle retryable errors
  * Convert XLOG_EOF to XLOG_BUSY in slab_load() to make that retryable by
    fs ops.
  * Have our test backend cleanup partial files when out of space
  * Display slab CRC in potatoctl
  * Add some logging
  * Update bench.sh to have smaller defaults to run on smaller systems
